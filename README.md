# K8200 Frankenprinter

Redesign of a redesign of a k8200. A lot of stuff I wasn't happy with in the original redesign so I've started re-re-redesigning it.

Original redesign was meant to use as many original K8200 hardware parts as possible, this version doesn't take that into consideration and uses longer 8mm rods, a stiffer bed mounting plate, and probably a bunch of other stuff I've forgotten about.

Not going to even attempt a BOM because I'm cutting random screws to length to make fit so finding 32.7mm long screws is probably impossible.

ugly but functional, work in progress.

Makes use of the x-carriage part found here: https://github.com/josefprusa/Prusa3
